### üéØ Project Scope:

This project investigates the relationship between bonus distribution efficiency and business outcomes. By analyzing performance and allocation data, the goal was to identify gaps in the existing model and optimize the process to support customer satisfaction, profitability, and strategic alignment.

**Key areas of focus:**

* Bonus allocation vs. KPI performance alignment
* Reducing inconsistencies and variance in distribution
* Proposing a data-driven strategy to optimize resource use and satisfaction

---

### üóÉÔ∏è Data Overview:

The project leverages data from various internal systems:

* **Bonus Allocation Data:** Historical records of bonuses distributed by region, performance level, and time period
* **Performance Metrics:** KPI achievement levels, customer ratings, and related operational indicators
* **Budget and Financial Data:** Bonus budget limits, financial outcomes, and cost structures

**Data Sources:**

* HR and Finance ERP systems
* Performance tracking software
* CRM systems for satisfaction metrics

---

### üî¨ Methodology:

**1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:**

* Extracted structured data from ERP and HR systems
* Cleaned and standardized data using Python (pandas) and SQL

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

* Analyzed patterns in bonus distribution
* Identified misalignment between KPI performance and bonus allocations

**3. Optimization Modeling:**

* Used statistical and predictive techniques to model optimal distribution
* Simulated different bonus strategies to measure impact

**4. Dashboard Development:**

* Built interactive Power BI dashboards for real-time monitoring and performance insights
* Enabled business users to track budget usage and fairness across teams

---

### üß∞ Tools and Technologies:

**Programming & Analysis:** Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn), SQL
**Visualization:** Power BI
**Collaboration & Versioning:** Git, GitHub
**Optimization Techniques:** Rule-based modeling, basic machine learning regressions, scenario simulations

---

### üîë Key Insights:

* **Distribution Variance:** Identified high variance in bonus payouts not explained by KPI differences
* **Cost Control:** Found that optimized allocation could cut overspending while improving fairness
* **Performance Link:** Clear alignment of bonuses with KPIs increased motivation and satisfaction
* **Business Impact:** Projected to increase revenue by 20% and profit margin by 10% through targeted improvements

---

### üìà Results:

* Reduced variance in bonus distribution
* Improved alignment with KPIs
* Increased transparency and trust in the allocation process
* Delivered a scalable, repeatable model for future bonus planning
